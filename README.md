Creating Data Products Week3 P1.-
This the html presentation for Week3 Project 1. There are 58 slides in the deck, be patient while loading. Graphs are interactive. Enjoy the read!

The initial full version of the file is called Week3P1All.html and has 1027 lines (on the .rmd file). The resulting html of 58 slides is 11MB  and too large to display in Github.io. I made a shorter 13 slides, smaller 7 MB, version called Week3P1AllShort.html that is small enough to be posted and hosted here. You will be able to see the full front part of the presentation, with graphs as required, but shorter.
